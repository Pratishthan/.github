# What is Pratishthan?

  Pratishthan is an idea conceived by the Founder, Sharad Hegde in 2014.
  An idea that was a result of his many years of experience creating world-class service frameworks, solutions and
  platforms. It was envisaged to be a firm that provides world-class technology solutions to small and medium
  enterprises
  (SMEs), startups and larger enterprises. The one thing that would go on to differentiate Pratishthan from others was
  the
  clarity that the Pratishthan family would work only on projects where it could bring tangible business value for its
  clients.

  The family has grown over the years and they come from all over India and call Bangalore their home. Nestled in the
  calm
  environs of a tree-covered office space, we have been putting our experience in fintech, enterprise solutions,
  technology frameworks and emerging technologies to create an ecosystem that helps the mind thrive and creates a
  fertile
  ground for creative solutions.

  Our people are our biggest assets and they bring with them not just their technical prowess, but also multiple
  talents.
  The amalgamation of the left and the right brain functions is what helps us help our clients.
